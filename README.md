# Sino Project Docs

Sino is a blockchain betting protocol, on top of which anyone can build single-spin games. It functions without a liquidity pool and without a human counterparty.

This is possible because all bets are placed and settled using the SINO token. The Sino betting smart contract burns tokens when a bet is placed and mints tokens to pay out winnings.

In addition, there's an house edge built into all bets to:

* Make the SINO token deflationary
* Generate rewards for game creators
* Top up the jackpot fund
