# The Token

SINO (called SINOTN02 on the testnet) is an ERC-20 token with an initial supply of 10,000,000. The supply will fluctuate over time because the betting contract has the ability to burn tokens (on bet placing) and mint tokens (to pay winning bets).

No human has the ability to inflate the supply because the token contract ownership was transferred to the betting contract at the very beginning.
