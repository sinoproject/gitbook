# Jackpot Fund

As explained in the Tokenomics section, every time the Sino betting contract settles a winning bet, it also mints tokens that get added to the jackpot fund.

### Who can win the jackpot?

Every time a gambler places a bet, no matter the size, they have chance of winning both that bet and the jackpot. The jackpot **winning probability is set in stone inside the contract and it is 1%**.

So, when the Sino betting contract receives the random number between 1-10000 to settle a bet (see the Tokenomics section), if the bet is deemed a winner and the random number is between 1-100 then the bet's gambler also wins the jackpot.
