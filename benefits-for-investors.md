# Benefits For Investors

### Hodler

SINO tokenomics are deflationary, so you can simply hold the token as an asset that will become scarcer over time.

### Token Swap Rewards

Get rewarded by a dex (e.g. Uniswap) for creating pools to swap SINO for other tokens (ETH, USDT, etc).

### Agent Rewards

Create a web app with your own games on top of the Sino betting smart contract. When placing bets on chain, make the app pass your "agent" Ethereum address. If the bet is a winner, the Sino betting contract will send you SINO tokens as a commission.
